KADSwiftDrawing
======
**KADSwiftDrawing** is a demo application for drawing/painting in an iOS application, using the Swift programming language.
The base of the code KADSwiftDraw.swift is heavily based on the Objective-C Tutorial [Smooth Freehand Drawing on iOS](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/smooth-freehand-drawing-on-ios--mobile-13164) by Akiel Khan. All credits for the basic line drawing code go to him.

Purpose of the software is demonstrating a simple drawing class in Swift, which can be used as a solid starting point for developers looking for simple drawing functionalities. I added some controls for line width and color, and an eraser functionality as well. (Who draws without an eraser anyway?)
